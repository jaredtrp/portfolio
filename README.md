# Jared Worsham Portfolio

This website is a demonstration of my skills as a web developer, utilizing HTML and CSS, including flexbox, and media queries.


## Navigation

The primary nav bar at the top is built in flexbox, and contains a simple logo, along with 4 links, 3 of which are anchor links which will jump to the corresponding location on the page, and the RESUME link which goes to my LinkedIn account.

## Hero

The hero section contains my name, title, and a portrait of myself. This section utilizes flexbox and media queries to rearrange the content as needed for smaller screens.

## Work

This section contains the 2 major projects I've worked on so far. It uses flexbox and media queries. If the user hovers over each project, it will drop in opacity.

## Contact

The contact section contains links to assist the user in contacting me.
